António dedicated most of his professional life to researching, designing and developing systems in all kinds of environments, from desktop and mobile, to physical computing. He’s been involved in researching and working with Artificial Intelligence since the year 2000, and in the past couple of years has focused his attention on AI usage and development. After knowing Bruno for over a decade, they started working together on a way to automate Gregory and turn it into a tool anyone could use.
